# VulnerabilitiesTest
vulnerabilities scan using python 


to run the vulnerability detection scripts that are included with the tool. These scripts can detect and report on a wide range of known vulnerabilities in the target system or network.
When --script vuln is used, nmap will run a set of pre-defined scripts that search for known vulnerabilities in the target system or network. 
These scripts are designed to test for common vulnerabilities such as missing patches, misconfigured services, default passwords, and more.

By using --script vuln, you can quickly and easily scan a target system or network for known vulnerabilities without having to manually search for them. 

However, it's important to note that while --script vuln can be a useful tool for security auditing and testing, it should only be used on systems that you have permission to scan. 
unauthorised vulnerability scanning is illegal and unethical.
